5. Dropdown List:

```
{
  "content": "\nKarl: I moved to a new country last year. In the past, it would have been harder to stay in touch with my relatives, but now we can send instant messages and make video calls. Because of that, we talk all the time. Technology is probably something I am too dependent on, but I think most people use it for everything these days, and even young children have it in schools.\nLucy: I work in finance, and I have to keep up to date with global banking information and discuss it with co-workers. Many of them live in other countries, and it's technology that allows me to do this. I am therefore grateful for technology, but I am aware of some disadvantages, for example, that screen use can interfere with sleep. For this reason, I turn everything off by around 9 pm.\nBeth: Our family uses technology a lot. My sister even calls Mum from inside the same house! Although Dad tells us not to use it late at night, I often do anyway. Technology is great for watching movies and listening to music. I play games with my friends. They all buy the most recent models, which puts pressure on me to do the same thing. It is not cheap, but I can't get left behind!\nKen: I am a professional painter, so my job isn't traditionally connected to using computers. Perhaps I'll use one more in the future to support my business. I have a laptop at home, although I don't use it very much. My daughters have become very interested in it, so I tend to keep it locked away. Lots of my friends enjoy giving their kids access to games and music, but I worry about the effect on developing minds.\n        ",
